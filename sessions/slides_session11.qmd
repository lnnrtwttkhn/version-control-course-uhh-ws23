#### Learning questions

Some learning questions to pay attention to during the exercise:

-   How does forking differ from the previous approach to collaboration?
-   Did you notice any hurdles when comparing these different approaches to collaboration?
-   In which scenarios are different approaches to collaboration applicable?
