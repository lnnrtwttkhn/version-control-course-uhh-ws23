## Background

If you missed more than two course sessions, you are asked to complete an **additional assignment**.
This additional assignment **builds on the contents of previous course sessions** and is (roughly) the equivalent of what you would complete in a regular course session.
If you need help, please consult the relevant chapters in the [Version Control Book]({{< var links.book >}}) (in particular the chapter on [GitHub](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-intro.html)).
While the assignment covers many aspects of our course, it's not an exam.
So please [get in touch]({{< var links.email >}}) if you are getting stuck or have any questions about the assignment or the course contents.

**Submission Deadline:** Friday, Feb 2nd, 2024 

## Assignment

### Editing content on GitHub

#### Create a `README.md` file

If you did not create a `README.md` file in your `recipes` repository already:

1.    Go to your `recipes` repository's main page and click on "Add a README".
1.    Use Markdown syntax and add the most important facts about the repository.
1.    Click on "Commit changes" and write a relevant commit message.

#### Clean up your `recipes` repository

If you have unnecessary files in your `recipes` repository:

1.    Click on the file you want to delete and choose "Delete file".
1.    Commit the change and choose a commit message.
1.    Pull the changes to your local repository (i.e., to your computer).

You complete this assignment by sending a link to your `recipes` repository [to Lennart]({{< var links.email >}}).

### Forking 

1.    Find out what [forking](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-intro.html#forking-a-repository) is.
1.    Fork [Lennart's recipes repository](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/recipes/).
1.    Create an issue in Lennart's repository (maybe the repo is missing a great recipe?).
1.    Clone the *forked* repository to your computer.
1.    Create a new branch and make one or multiple commits, "fixing" the issue.
1.    Push your changes to GitHub.
1.    Create a pull request with your changes (hint: from the forked to the original repository) and refer to the issue.

You complete this assignment by sending a pull request to Lennart's `recipes` repository from a fork.

Hint: Check out [Matteo's contribution](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/recipes/pull/2) to Lennart's `recipes` repository for a similar procedure.

## Bonus: Tags and Releases

This is a bonus assignment.
It's not required to make up for more that two missed course sessions.
But maybe you are on a roll now, so why not?

1.    Read the [Tags and Releases chapter](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/tags-and-releases.html).
1.    **Create a tag**, marking the current version of your `recipes` repository.
1.    **Create a release** of your tagged repository version on GitHub.
1.    Try out the [Zenodo Sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/) to generate a DOI for your repository.
