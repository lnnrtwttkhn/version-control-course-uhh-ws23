**Extra exercise for missed sessions:**

Down below are the extra exercises you are required to do if you missed more than two of our sessions on fridays.

To help with the exercises you can check out the [Github chapter](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-intro.html).

### 1. **Create a Readme**

- Go to your repositories main page and click on **add a README**

- Use **Markdown syntax** and add the **most important facts** about the repository (link to our seminar website)

- Click on **Commit changes** and write a relevant **commit message**

### 2. **Clean up your repository** *(optional)* 

If you have unnecessary files in your repository:

-  Click on the file you want to delete and choose **Delete file**

- **Commit** the change and choose a **commit message**

- **Pull** the changes to your local repository

### 3. **Forking** 

-  Find out what [forking](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-intro.html#forking-a-repository) is
- **Fork the recipes repository** of Lennart
- Repeat the steps from the previous exercise using the forked repository:
    1. **Clone** the *forked* repository
    1. **Create a new branch** and create **one or multiple commits** "fixing" the issue
    1. **Push** your changes to GitHub
    1. **Create a pull request** with your changes (hint: from the fork to the original repo) and refer to the issue

- Lennart's `recipes` repository: <https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/recipes>
- The issue youre fixing could e.g. be adding a "missing recipe"
- You complete the assignment by sending a pull request to Lennarts “recipes” repository from a fork.

### 4. **Tags and Releases** *(Bonus)*

- Read the [Tags and Releases chapter](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/tags-and-releases.html)
- **Create a tag** marking your recipe repository version
- **Create a release** of your "finished" repository on GitHub
