    "text": "During this course, we want to ensure a safe, productive, and welcoming environment for everyone who attends. All participants and speakers are expected to abide by this code of conduct. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment in any form or by any means. If you experience harassment or hear of any incidents of unacceptable behavior, please reach out to the course instructor, Lennart Wittkuhn (lennart.wittkuhn@uni-hamburg.de), so that we can take the appropriate action.\nUnacceptable behavior is defined as:\n\nHarassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form, verbal abuse of any attendee, speaker, or other person. Examples include, but are not limited to, verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations, or threatening or stalking.\nDisruption of presentations throughout the course. We ask all participants to comply to the instructions of the speaker with regard to dedicated discussion space and time.\nParticipants should not take pictures of any activity in the course room without asking all involved participants for consent and receiving this consent.\n\nA first violation of this code of conduct will result in a warning, and subsequent violations by the same person can result in the immediate removal from the course without further warning. The organizers also reserve the right to prohibit attendance of excluded participants from similar future workshops, courses or meetings they organize."

    "text": "Email\nDear course participants,\nYou are receiving this email because you are enrolled in the course “Version Control of Code & Data”, taking place this winter semester at the University of Hamburg. We are excited that you have signed up for this course and can’t wait to delve into the world of version control with you. Our first session takes place this Friday, October 20, 2023, from 10:15 to 11:45 a.m. at Von-Melle-Park 5, Room 4047.\nIn order to tailor the course to your prior experience and needs, we have prepared a short survey with a few questions. Please complete the survey before our first session, ideally by Thursday evening (October 19, 2023). This will give us enough time to review your responses before our first session on Friday.\nThe survey can be accessed here: https://version-control-intro.formr.org\nA few technical remarks about the survey: The survey will ask you for two codewords: a personal codeword and a course code.\nThe personal codeword is used to associate your responses with a unique identifier. This will allow us to relate your responses across surveys while ensuring anonymity. Note that you can also complete the survey without providing a personal codeword. By providing a personal codeword, you will allow us to draw more detailed insights from your responses that will help us improve the course for you. The survey will contain an explanation of how to generate your personal codeword.\nThe course codeword is used to tag your responses as coming from a course participant at the University of Hamburg. We might also use the survey to collect responses from participants in other course settings. The course codeword allows us to distinguish responses from different course settings.\nThe course codeword is: -------- (course password will be announced during the course)\nApart from answering the survey, you don’t need to prepare anything else for our first session on Friday.\nFurther information about the course can be found on our course website: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ws23/\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you for the first session on Friday!\nBest wishes, Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

With features such as unambiguous version control, a wide spectrum of data transport mechanisms, convenient provenance capture, and re-execution for verification or as an alternative to storage and transport, it enables and facilitates many aspects of open and reproducible science: collaboration, sharing, analytical transparency, computational reproducibility of digital research objects, and disk-space aware storage and computing workflows on infrastructure that ranges from personal laptops up to supercomputers."

Some course preparation may occur outside of the class.\n Interactive Discussions & Quizzes (up to 15 minutes): Course participants collectively address any inquiries related to the session’s content and online materials. Instructor-led quiz questions may also be interspersed throughout.\n Exercises & Implementation (up to 60 minutes): Course participants actively delve into hands-on exercises and assignments.\n\nNote, that course participants are not required (but are of course free) to work on course materials outside of class time.

In this course, students will have the opportunity to learn at home using the available course materials. We will, however, reserve time in the beginning of each class (roughly 15 - 30 minutes of 90 minutes) to allow all course participants to catch up with the content of the current session.

This is one of the rare occasions when we will ask you to complete a small task outside of class time.\nWe are very much looking forward to our next session on Friday when we will take our first steps in using Git! For this session, it is important that you verify whether Git is installed on your computer. To do this, we kindly ask you to complete the following tasks before our session on Friday:\n\nPlease review the “Installation” chapter in our course guide: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/installation.html\nComplete our survey regarding the installation process: https://version-control-installation.formr.org\n\nOverall, this should not take more than 15 minutes.\nPlease ensure that you complete the survey before our next session, ideally by Thursday evening (November 2nd, 2023). This will give us enough time to review your responses before our first session on Friday.\nApart from checking your Git installation and answering the survey, you don’t need to prepare anything else for our next session on Friday.\nFurther information about the course can be found on our course website: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ws23/\nIf you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to contact us directly via email.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you for the next session on Friday!\nBest wishes, Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nThe digital objects on our computers are in a constant state of flux. Manuscripts, programming code and research data are changed continuously over long periods of time, often in close collaboration with others. A systematic documentation of these changes forms the basis for controlled and reproducible work on code and data. In a seminar with hands-on exercises, course participants will learn “Effective Progress Tracking and Collaboration: An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data”.\nVersion control is the notebook for a digital world and Git is probably the best known version control system. Git allows to precisely document changes in digital objects and thus to track who changed what, when, how and why in a file. Changes can be revised, versions can be compared and restored. In addition, it is possible to work simultaneously on the same file and systematically integrate parallel versions. In addition, Git enables effective collaboration. Via platforms such as GitHub or GitLab, code and data can be shared with the world, transparently viewed by others, used and collaboratively developed. In this way, version control helps to ensure that knowledge generated from data is transparent, accessible and verifiable. As an effective method for storing and manipulating code and data, version control thus represents a core competency of data literacy.\nBecause Git was developed for versioning small, text-based files (such as programming code), its usability with larger, binary files (such as image or video data) is limited for technical reasons. The open-source software DataLad extends the features of Git to provide version control for large data sets (up to several terabytes). DataLad is applicable to arbitrary data structures and is independent of any central infrastructure or third-party vendors. Like Git, DataLad allows tracking changes to data and restoring previous versions of a data set. Furthermore, DataLad allows you to capture the digital provenance of data and accurately reproduce analyses of the data. In addition, DataLad allows to publish data on a variety of platforms or use existing data."
